            1.What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
          </h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            DOM means Document Object Model. Which is basically used on the Web
            for documents. Like HTML content used as a tree structure, every
            node of the tree represents a part of a document such as an element,
            attributes, or text. <br><br> The main purpose of the DOM is that it gives us
            a dynamic user interface which contains a lot of activities from the
            user on the Web without requiring a full page reload. It gives us
            flexibility for programs to dynamically access and manipulate the
            content, structure, and style of a web page. Also we see that the
            developers create an interactive web page where they can respond to
            user input and change their appearances.

            2.How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods
          </h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            We can use several ways to select the HTML elements using DOM. Here’s the  few most common 
             methods to select the HTML elements.
            <ul class="list-disc mt-2">
                <li>getElementById(): This method is used for the ID. We can select any html elements by 
                     using a unique ID.</li>
                <li>getElementsByClassName(): This method is used for class names. When we use this 
                 method by using a class name it gives us a return array-like object of all elements</li>
                <li>getElementsByTagName(): This method is used for html tag names. We can select from 
                     the HTML document by using their tag names. And it also gives us the full content of 
                      that tag like-array object.</li>
                <li>querySelector(): This method is used for CSS selector. We select any elements like a 
                     CSS selector.</li>
                <li>querySelectorAll(): This is also used for CSS selectors but it gives us a nodelist 
                     containing all elements of this selector. </li>
            </ul>

          <h5 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">3.What is an event bubble?</h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            Event Bubble is a concept that occurs in a particular element in the
            Document Object Model (DOM) and at the same time it triggers on all
            of the parent elements in a sequential order. <br><br> This is the “bubbling
            up” through the DOM tree. When a Button trigger The event handler on
            an element is first performed by the browser when an event is
            triggered on that element, and the event is then propagated to the
            parent element. This procedure keeps on until the event reaches the
            document , which is the topmost element in the DOM tree.

            4.What is a callback function and why will you use it?
          </h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            Callback function is a type of function that uses a function as a
            parameter to another function.It is subsequently called inside the
            inner function to carry out a certain task. <br><br> I would use the Callback
            function to adjust a function's behaviour without directly changing
            its source code. And also a callback function can be used to handle
            the response once it becomes available and using this callback
            function we can create more dynamic and adaptable programs that can
            handle a wide range of use cases.
