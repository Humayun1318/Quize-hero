           <span class=" text-red-500">map()</span> creates a new array with the results of 
            calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It returns a new array 
            with the same length as the original array.<br> 
            <span class="text-red-500">filter()</span> creates a new array with all elements 
             that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array with only 
             the elements that satisfy the condition. <br>
             <span class="text-red-500">find()</span> returns the value of the first element in the array that 
              satisfies the provided testing function. It returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition.

            <span class="text-red-500">forEach()</span> executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not

          </h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            <span class="text-red-500">localStorage</span>:- localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and 
             apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will 
             persist even after the browser window is closed. <br>
             <span class="text-red-500">Session Storage</span>:- Session storage allows you to store data in the browser depending
             on the system memory and the data stored in the browser until the browser is closed. <br>
             <span class="text-red-500">cookie</span>:- A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web
             browser that the website can retrieve at a later time.

          <h5 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">3.What is <span class="text-red-500"> Event Loop </span> ? How does it Work ?</h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            <span class="text-red-500">Event loop</span> is a loop that continually checks the message queue for
           new events and executes them one by one in the order they are received. Each event is processed synchronously,
           meaning that each event must finish executing before the next event in the queue can be processed.
           Events can be added to the message queue from various sources, such as user interactions (like clicking a
           button), network requests, or timer events. When an event is added to the message queue, the event loop checks
           if there is any code currently executing. If there is no code executing, the event loop dequeues the event from
           the message queue and executes its associated callback function. If there is code executing, the event loop
           waits until the code has finished executing before dequeuing and processing the next event in the queue.

          </h5>
          <p class="text-base font-normal">
            <span class="text-red-500">chooseQuiz()</span> This function, chooseQuiz, takes two arguments: an index and
            givenAns.It first checks if there is an existing answer in the answers array that matches the ID of the quiz at the 
            given index in quizData. If there is, it updates the existing answer with the new givenAns value. If there is no
            existing answer, it creates a new answer object with the quiz information from quizData and the givenAns value,
            and adds it to the answers array. 
            Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers function with the updated answers array. <br>
            <span class="text-red-500">quizTimer()</span> This function, quizTimer, takes one argument,dismiss.
             If dismiss is true, the function clears the interval timer and returns.If dismiss is not true, the function sets the 
            interval timer to run every second. Within this interval function,it calculates the minutes and seconds left in the 
            quiz and displays them in the HTML element with the ID count.It also updates the count variable to keep track of the 
            elapsed time.If more than 60 seconds have passed, the function alternates between adding and removing classes to 
            change the color of the timer display.
